% 
% This is a package of MATLAB transcripts for the analytical models for
% regular/monochromatic wave attenuation by submerged and suspended
% flexible and rigid vegetation and kelp (Zhu and Zou, 2017; Zhu et al.,
% 2022), including two major functions,
% regularWaveDecayFlexibleVegetation.m and
% regularWaveDecayRigidVegetation.m, respectively, for wave attenuation by
% flexible and rigid vegetation/kelp. Type 'help' and the name of the
% function to see details.
% 
% Two EXAMPLES, exampleSubmergedVegetation.m and exampleSuspendedKelp.m,
% are given for submerged vegetation and suspended kelp, respectively.
